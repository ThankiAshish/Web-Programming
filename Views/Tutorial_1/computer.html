        Department of Computer Engineering is established in year 2006. The
        department offers BTech and MTech programs in computer engineering.The
        department also offers PhD program in Computer Engineering. Since its
        inception, BTech(CE) program was offered with intake of 60. Present
        intake is 120.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a four years (eight semester) full-time undergraduate program. Out
        of eight semesters, seven semesters are dedicated to in house study
        involving course work and projects. Final semester is dedicated to
        Industrial Project. Students spend entire eighth semester in an IT
        company and do a project.The curriculum is designed by keeping
        industrial and research needs, as well as the rapid development in the
        IT industry. Flexibility in curriculum is provided through Electives,
        Seminars and Projects. The program is supported by well-equipped
        laboratories consisting of the state-of-the-art servers & computers.
        This creates a lively and stimulating atmosphere to study Computer
        Engineering. The Faculty members publish their research work in national
        and international journals and conferences.
